	\vspace*{-0.24cm}
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Search for SM Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W bosons, which decay semileptonically
			\begin{itemize}
				\item No other analysis has looked for \HWWlvjj (\MH=125\gev)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item It has a large $\sigma\times{BR}$!
					\item Why? It's a difficult search! Lots of backgrounds!
				\end{itemize}
				%\item After MC corrections all kinematic variables show acceptable agreement between data and MC
				%\item The data-driven QCD model works well
				%\item All relevant systematics have been taken into account
			\end{itemize}
			\item Matrix element probabilities calculated for every event in data and MC
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Adds an additional handle with which to pick out the signal
				\item Combined with additional variables in a BDT
			\end{itemize}
			\item No significant excess is found in $\sim$20\fbinv of 8\TeV data from CMS
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 95\% CLs upper limit on $\sigma/\sigma_{\text{SM}}$ is set at 5.4 (significance: 0.903)
				\item But there is hope!!!
			\end{itemize}

	\begin{alertblock}{Future of this channel}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Cross section increase for \ggH (\Wjets): 2.4 (1.7)
			\item Assuming sensativity goes as $\sqrt{\mathcal{L}}$ (i.e. no other improvements) an analysis at \CM{13\tev} would reach Standard Model sensitivity at 80\fbinv
			\begin{itemize}
				\item We're so close to crossing the 100\fbinv (\CM{13\tev}) mark!
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
